# GitLite-A-Simplified-Version-Control-System
A simplified Git-like version control system in C++ that stores CSV data in tree structures (AVL, B-Tree, Red-Black) as separate files. Processes data line-by-line to minimize memory usage while supporting branches, commits, and efficient change detection using Merkle trees.
